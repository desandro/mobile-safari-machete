## <meta viewport>

+ By default, iPhone / iPad window size is 980px wide
+ HTML5 Boilerplate recommended `width=device-width` will set this value to the _native width of the device_. 320px for iPhone, 768px for iPad.
+ But, if user opens page in _landscape_, width will not be default width of _orientation_. For that, you need to disable zoom, with `width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0`.
+ Annihilate any sort of zooming, with `width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no`.
